IDEONE COMPILER
===============

Ideone is a pastebin as well as online compiler which supports more than 100 languages. 

HOW TO USE IT
=============

Clone it on your local machine and view it on localhost. Right now it isn't available on any website. 

P.S: If you are getting error while compiling, open ideone.php file and write down your ideone username and API's password. It should work now.
